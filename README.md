## Overview

Welcome to my implementation of the Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page challenge. This project was undertaken to enhance my front-end development skills, focusing on creating a responsive layout and interactive elements.

### Challenge Details:

- **Task:** Replicate the provided Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Objectives:** Achieve a close match to the design, ensuring responsiveness and hover states for interactive elements.

## Project Structure

- The `/design` folder contains mobile and desktop design versions in JPG format.
- All required assets are stored in the `/images` folder, pre-optimized for use.
- Refer to `style-guide.md` for crucial design information, including color palette and fonts.
